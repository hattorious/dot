This has been driving me nuts finding any good documentation on the PUA code points that powerlines uses so I'm gathering what I've found on the net.

U+E0A0     Version control branch
U+E0A1     LN (line) symbol
U+E0A2     Closed padlock
U+E0B0     Rightwards black arrowhead
U+E0B1     Rightwards arrowhead
U+E0B2     Leftwards black arrowhead
U+E0B3     Leftwards arrowhead

Some additonal interesting code points:
U+F8FF     Apple Inc. symbol (PUA)
U+00B1  ±   plus-minus sign
U+27A6  ➦   heavy black curved upwards and rightwards arrow
U+1368  ፨   ethiopic paragraph separator
U+2764  ❤   heavy black heart


To enter these into vim either yank from this file or off the web (http://graphemica.com) or:
ctrl + v + u + f 8 f f
